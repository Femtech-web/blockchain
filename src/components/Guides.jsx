            Welcome to this guide on securely setting up a MetaMask wallet. 
            This guide focuses on the security choices you can make when setting up your MetaMask wallet; 
            MetaMask is your entry point to the world of Ethereum - a
            blockchain platform designed for running apps and smart contracts.

            <h4 className="text-white leading-8 text-xl mb-2">What is Metamask for Android ?</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-300">
             The MetaMask mobile app consists of two main parts: a wallet and a web browser. The wallet supports any token compatible with Ethereum, and the web browser
             is preconfigured for interacting with dapps and smart-contracts. MetaMask was first released in 2016, as a browser-extension, by ConsenSys - 
             the first company focused on building decentralized tools and infrastructure. Both MetaMask and ConsenSys have played monumental roles in bringing Ethereum to the mainstream. 
             It is hard to overstate the effect MetaMask has had on the Ethereum ecosystem. By making dapps and smart-contracts simple and intuitive to use, activity on the Ethereum 
             blockchain has enjoyed consistent growth.Metamask is an open-source wallet, active development happens on github. The wallet has tons of features, and is constantly 
             being updated and improved. MetaMask is available as a browser-extension for Chrome, Firefox, Brave, and Edge. In September of 2020, MetaMask released a mobile app for iOS and Android.

            <h4 className="text-white leading-8 sm:text-xl text-2xl mb-2">How can you Download and install Metamask for Android?</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-300">
                From your mobile device, open the 'Play Store' and search for 
                'MetaMask' and click 'install'.
                Trust, but verify. When using any cryptocurrency wallet, it is important to make sure
                you are downloading the correct version. Check the store listing for the following info: 
                Version: 1.0.10 as of January 26, 2021 Offered by: MetaMask The `Version` number and the `Updated on` 
                date will change as the app is updated over time. The important part to verify is the `Offered by` field.
                Remember the phrase trust, but verify. Taking the extra step to verify can prevent loss of funds. 
                Trust, but verify is an important concept in having a security mindset.

            <h4 className="text-white leading-8 sm:text-xl text-2xl mb-2">How can you create and set up MetaMask for Android?</h4>
            <p className="text-gray-300">
            MetaMask is a very easy wallet to get started with. No email address or personal identification is required. The process consists of two main steps - creating a password and backing
             up your seed phrase. You will be ready to explore the world of Ethereum in just a few minutes. MetaMask supports any token built on the Ethereum blockchain. You might come across 
             terms such as ERC-20 and ERC-721; these are just types of tokens. Safely backing up your MetaMask wallet is essential. This guide covers in detail how to securely back up your seed phrase in Section 5.
              Securely back up your seed phrase.MetaMask uses BIP39 to generate a seed phrase for your wallet. Your seed phrase will cover every token, address, and transaction generated by your wallet. 
              Think of it as your backup master key.When creating a new MetaMask Wallet, the default method is to create your wallet within the app. The more advanced method is to generate your own seed phrase directly. 
              We created detailed guides on how to create your own seed phrase.By following the appropriate directions, you can generate a seed phrase that is more secure than the default method used by wallets.

                        Your seed phrase is the master key to all of your cryptocurrency funds. MetaMask Wallet uses BIP39, which is the current industry best practice for generating seed phrases. The majority of modern wallets today use BIP39. This means your MetaMask 
                        seed phrase can be used to access your funds across many different wallets without knowing your MetaMask password.
                        Securely backing up your seed phrase is the most important step in creating a new wallet. To emphasize how important this is, consider how someone with your seed phrase could access your funds without you knowing.
                        Imagine a bad actor has your seed phrase, and you have your Metamask Wallet locked down with 2FA, IP address whitelisting, blocked tor access, and all the other security features. The attacker could simply open any wallet application, and import your seed phrase. The attacker now has access to all of your funds.
                        We want you to have a secure backup, so this never happens to you Nine out of ten wallet providers only mention one way to backup your seed phrase - by writing the seed phrase on paper. Wallet providers only mention this paper backup method because it is easy for beginners to do. Paper backups are simply not that secure.
                        We did extensive research and compiled the best ways to backup your seed phrase. We cover all the most well-known options, including next-generation options like how to back up your seed phrase in Vault12.
                        Once you have safely backed up your seed phrase, you can initialize your wallet using any BIP39 compatible wallet. In the next section, you will learn how you can initialize a MetaMask wallet using your seed phrase.
